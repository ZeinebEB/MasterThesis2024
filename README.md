# FFTRadNet: Raw High Definition Radar for Multi-Task Learning

## Overview
This repository contains the code for FFTRadNet, a framework for multi-task learning with high definition radar data. FFTRadNet is designed to handle raw radar data and perform multiple tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation.

## Introduction
High-definition radar provides rich spatial information which is useful for a variety of tasks in autonomous driving. FFTRadNet leverages this data for multiple learning tasks, enhancing the performance and robustness of radar-based perception systems.
